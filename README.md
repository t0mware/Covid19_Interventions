# Covid19_Interventions
Maths in Action code repository

This is my code repository for implementing alternative stratagies for Covid-19 in the UK and analysing their costs based on different estimates. The code is incomplete and still a work in progress so will be updated over the next few months.

Covid19 is the working file, with each subsequent file being and functions associated.
